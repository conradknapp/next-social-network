React framework

- Used to create server-rendered or universal React apps
- Zero config-no webpack/babelrc files aside from installing Next and creating a pages folder with some JS files
- You don't have to know anything about webpack
- Server-side rendering out of the box, you get performance and SEO benefits. You get code splitting and dynamic imports

- Next will render our React code (our JavaScript code) on the server without any changes. It's all done automatically

- Page directory is our routing system; no need for React router or defining routes. Pages directory declares our routes
